# INFO-201-Final-Project
Final Project 
The data set we will be working with is the average cost of undergraduate college by state, 
and the data set is from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kfoster150/avg-cost-of-undergrad-college-by-state,
which is a combination of all 330.20 Tables from the NCES Digest of Education
Statistics since 2013, and the data set is annually updated.

I have built my own shiny application. The application provides the user with the ability to interactively explore the 
dataset. It has five sets of pages. One page (the opening page/the landing page) displays 
the purpose/importance of the project, the source of the data of the project and a sample of the dataset. 
The three interactive pages display approriate charts/tables. The conclusion page displays a description ofthe notable insight 
discoverd in our project. Here is the link to our project--https://steven1.shinyapps.io.....
