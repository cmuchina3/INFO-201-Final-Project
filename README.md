# INFO-201-Final-Project
Final Project 
The data set we will be working with is the average cost of undergraduate college by state, 
and the data set is from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kfoster150/avg-cost-of-undergrad-college-by-state,
which is a combination of all 330.20 Tables from the NCES Digest of Education
Statistics since 2013, and the data set is annually updated.

We have built our own shiny application. The application provides the user with the ability to interactively explore the 
dataset. It has five sets of pages. One page (the opening page/the landing page) displays 
the purpose/importance of the project, the source of the data of the project and a sample of the dataset. 
The three interactive pages display approriate charts/tables. The conclusion page displays a description ofthe notable insight 
discoverd in our project. Here is the link to our project--https://cm03.shinyapps.io/INFO-201-Final-Project/?_ga=2.45508775.2046783816.1678305619-1719864854.1678140601
